            <p class="ws">Why Should I use WordPress?</p>
            <p class="firstfaq">Other than being the world's most popular website creation platform 
                (powering over 30% of the internet's websites), WordPress offers a 
                wealth of tools, plugins and themes that allow you to create any 
                kind of website imaginable. From blogs, to online stores, to business 
                websites, to websites about cats, WordPress can do just about anything. 
                Unlike some website building providers, WordPress is not a proprietary 
                software or platform, so the way you build your website at one provider 
                will be the same if you move to another provider meaning you don't have 
                to rebuild your website from scratch.</p>

                <hr>
                    <p class="ws">Why should I choose Bluehost for my WordPress website?</p>
                    <p class="firstfaq">Bluehost has been recommended directly by WordPress.org

                        for boosting traffic, protecting your visitors and backing up your content easily

                        hosting that is secured by experts. After you have completed your new account setup 
                        and picked a WordPress theme, you are automatically connected to the latest version

                        WordPress admin (WP Admin) panel from there. Once you are inside of your WP Admin panel, 
                        simply create a new page or start editing an existing page to the way you want it to look.</p>
